Group 2 - The Python Pilots

Project requirements
In this project you are required to:
Implement a GUI application in Python 3
The GUI app interfaces the user to an underlying data store.
The project should be completed using the agile principles articulated in Pilone & Miles.

Make sure to meet with your instructor as regularly as you require to ensure that the project is scoped appropriately – neither too narrowly nor too widely.

Beyond those requirements, you and your team are free to choose your own domains to create a solution project for.

There are four parts to the project, A, B, C, and D.

Part A

Meet with other members of your assigned team. I will have created the teams with the goal to optimize the mix among coding, GUI, and database skills.
Come up with a concept for your application.
Create an initial set of project requirements expressed as user stories. Make sure to identify all the relevant project stakeholders.
The user stories must have estimates of completion times.
Meet with the instructor to discuss the concept and initial set of user stories.

Due: GitHub repository URL for your project. There should be a README in the repo with relevant documentation i.e. team members, stakeholders, requirements etc.
